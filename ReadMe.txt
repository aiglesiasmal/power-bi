Some of the files in this repository are not in Power BI format as they recquire R Studio packages for visualization,
and that could cause difficulties for visualizations. Therefore, they are shown in a PDF format. 

The first folder has two files:
-The first is 'SUPPLY_CHAIN_ANALYTICS' that shows an analysis of orders from a company using corellation analysis, 
clustering, sales prediction, key influencers and a decomposition tree. 
-The second folder detects outliers on datasets using different methods such as Zscore, Tukey`s, LOF(Local Outlier Factor) 
and Cook's distance. In addition to those methods, three ways to visualize outliers are supported: Scatter plot, box plot
and density plot.

The second folder is a sales analysis dashboard using corporate data to obtain KPIs and analyze sales performance by
product, region, country, year,etc.
