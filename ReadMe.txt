Some of the files in this repository are not in Power BI format as they recquire R Studio packages for visualization,
and that could cause difficulties for visualizations. Therefore, they are shown in a PDF format. 

The first folder has two files:
-The first is 'SUPPLY_CHAIN_ANALYTICS' that shows an analysis of orders from a company using corellation analysis, 
clustering, sales prediction, key influencers and a decomposition tree. 
-The second is 'OUTLIERS_DETECTION', that detects outliers on datasets using different methods such as Zscore, Tukey`s, LOF(Local Outlier Factor) 
and Cook's distance. In addition to those methods, three ways to visualize outliers are supported: Scatter plot, box plot
and density plot.

The second folder is an open data tool to visualize and filter NGOs based on location and analyze the dataset provided by the local government.

The third folder is a sales analysis dashboard using corporate data to obtain KPIs and analyze sales performance by
product, region, country, year,etc.
